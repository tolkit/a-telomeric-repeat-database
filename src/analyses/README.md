# Analyses

I'm using gotree (https://github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree). Which has handy functions to deal with the entire NCBI taxonomy tree.

I make the tree with `bash update_tree.bash`.

What do I want to show here?

[] Tree with any telomeric repeat other than the canonical?
[] Tree with number of different telomeric repeats at higher clades?
[] Ancestral telomeric repeat?
[] Unresolved telomeric repeats?
[] Curated table of telomeric repeats.
[] Histogram of current repeats
